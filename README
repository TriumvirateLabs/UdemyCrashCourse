Welcome! Getting started with this image is very simple. Each of the 30 installed languages has a dedicated directory with a starter file you can run. Below are the commands to execute each of these files. To run the starter code, change into the language's directory (for example, `cd /home/root/CrashCourse/Ada`) and run the relevant command. There's also a convenient script to execute all* of the `Hello, world!`s located in `/home/root` (the same directory you boot into when running this image) named `sanity_check.sh`. To execute it, run `bash sanity_check.sh`.

*Erlang, Occam-Ï€, and SuperCollider are not included in this script so they must be run manually.

NOTES:
     Dart: You must instead cd with `cd /home/root/CrashCourse/Dart/hello`
     Erlang: Scripts are executed in an interactive shell. To exit the shell, type `init:stop().`
     OccamPi: This language is still being modernized, so an alternative [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thron/doccam) must be used for now
     SuperCollider: Two starter scripts (hello1.scd and hello2.scd) are provided. After running each, you'll need to exit the session with CTRL C
